# Baba Is You
By Johan "Sacane" Ramaroson and Alan "Nova9" Guyollot.
This is a our "remake" version of the real game "Baba is you" by Arvi Teikari, this is a project done for my studies.
we used some Assets owned by Arvi Teikari (under a fair-use) and others are made by Tom Coulmance.

## How to play ? 

First you have to make sure that the file "baba.jar" is in the same folder than the folder "src".
Then you can type into your terminal ```java --enable-preview -jar baba.jar <options>```
If there is no specified option the game will start with the default level.

You can play a specified level like this : 

```java --enable-preview -jar baba.jar --level name: <levelX.txt>```

You can also play several levels by specify a folder like this : 

```java --enable-preview -jar baba.jar --levels name: <name folder>```
